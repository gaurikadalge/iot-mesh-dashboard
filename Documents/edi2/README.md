# IoT Mesh Network – Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a web-based dashboard designed for monitoring and visualizing an IoT mesh network. The system focuses on the software layer, providing a user interface to represent node connectivity, data flow, and network status in a mesh-based IoT environment.

## Project Scope
- Frontend implementation of an IoT mesh monitoring system
- Visualization of node status and network topology
- Designed for future integration with real IoT hardware

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Interactive dashboard UI
- Simulated IoT node data
- Network status visualization
- Responsive design

## Architecture
The system follows a layered IoT architecture:
- IoT Nodes (simulated)
- Mesh Network Layer (conceptual)
- Web Dashboard (implemented)

## Future Scope
- Integration with ESP32 / LoRa / ESP-NOW
- Real-time data using MQTT / WebSockets
- Backend API (Node.js / Flask)
- Database integration
